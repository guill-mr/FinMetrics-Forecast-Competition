  # IMPORTANT: We fitted an xgb with various params
  # but the otuputs had very high variability so we
  # ended up looping through them 10000 times to look
  # at their mean and median for their prediction of t = 501
  # and both were around 0.325,
  # so that's the value we want to use for the prediction.
  # In the end our prediction is just a function that outputs 
  # an scalar that we maually input, but this manual input 
  # comes from somewhere.
  # the rest of the function is actually what we used for the round
  # of fittings to arrive at the mean and median.
  
  # PD: the nrounds is for each fitting. we used 1k round for each 
  # of the 10k fittings.
  
  # IN GENERAL, we could also have left the function with the 
  # 10k iterations and the output being the mean of the results,
  # but we thought you would appreciate our code not taking 15 minutes 
  # to run :)
